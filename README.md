🌐 Live site: (GitHub Pages – https://purpur138.github.io/gd-lists-hub/)

A lightweight, static hub that collects and organizes Geometry Dash community lists in one place.
No accounts, no tracking, no unnecessary features — just a clean, fast way to find lists.

About the Project

Geometry Dash Lists Hub is a single-page, static website created to centralize many Geometry Dash lists that are currently scattered across Google Docs, spreadsheets, and various websites.

The goal is not to replace existing lists, but to:

make them easier to find,

remove unnecessary duplicates,

and present them in a clear, minimal format.

This project is meant to stay simple, transparent, and community-friendly.

Main Features

📂 Category-based layout
Lists are grouped into clear, collapsible sections.

🔍 Per-category search
Each category has its own search bar for fast filtering.

🧠 Smart de-duplication system
Duplicate entries are removed using clear priority rules:

URL

Title + website host

Title only (fallback)

🔗 Safe external links
All links open in a new tab with proper security attributes.

⚡ Fast & lightweight
No frameworks, no backend, no build process.

🎨 Minimal UI
Inspired by Geometry Dash list aesthetics — focused on content, not visuals.

Roadmap (Loose)

Improve duplicate detection as the dataset grows

Add small UX improvements where useful

Keep the site fast and readable

Avoid feature bloat

Final note (important)

This project is intentionally not:

a social platform

a ranking authority

a replacement for original lists

It’s a hub, nothing more — and that’s the point.
